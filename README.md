Powershell tsahrk scripts to help with large scale pcap analysis

This came around due to being handed 40Gb of pcap to analyze in a week with only tool provided being wireshark on windows. Goal was to get an overview of common protocols fields for that large of a set of pcaps without having to use the Wireshark GUI. They are easy to modify for more or less fields from wireshark/tshark.

# powershell_tshark_scritps
Powershell tsahrk scripts to help with large scale pcap analysis.  
My first submission on github. Thought it important to give back to IT coomunity since I have taken so much from them.
This came around due to being handed 40Gb of pcap to analyze in a week with only tool provided being wireshark on windows. Goal was to get an overview of common protocols fields for that large of a set of pcaps without having to use the Wireshark GUI. They are easy to modify for more or less fields from wireshark/tshark from https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/.
